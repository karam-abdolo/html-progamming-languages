    <td>Being the most learned at the moment, Python will soon increase its utilization popularity as well. Due to elegant and simple syntax, it is considered to be the easiest language to learn and is used for teaching programming. It is widely used for machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), data science as well as for mathematics, statistics, computational science. Being both simple and powerful, Python allows streamlining the development process of robust applications: web or mobile.

</td>
    <td>Despite similar names, Java has little in common with JavaScript. It is an object-oriented, interpreted programming language that was the first one allowing you to write the code once and run it anywhere. This language can be used for the development of applications of all sizes both web and mobile as well as for developing enterprise-level applications and working with Big Data.

</td>
    <td>C++ appeared as an improved version of the C language introducing object-oriented features. It offers a lot of compilers and libraries to build powerful and reliable solutions that can handle high performance and rich functionality. C++ easily adapts to ecosystem or hardware changes and is a perfect option for cloud computing as well as for game development. It is one of the most difficult languages to learn.
